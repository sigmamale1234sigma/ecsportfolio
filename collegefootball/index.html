	  I am in 9th grade at skyline highschool, and I love football. One of my favorite hobbies is to wake up on saturdays on watch college football.
	  I've seen a lot of highlights over the years, but these are my top three favorite plays of all time.

	  1. Arkansas's crazy kick return touchdown against Tenesee

	  2. Alabama's game winning touchdown throw to beat georgia in the national championship.

	  3. Auburn crazy kick six return against alambama.
